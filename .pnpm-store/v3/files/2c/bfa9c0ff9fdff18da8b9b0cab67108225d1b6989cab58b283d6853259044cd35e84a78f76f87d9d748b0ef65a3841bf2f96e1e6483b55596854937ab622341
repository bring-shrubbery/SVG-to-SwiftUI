# Prettier configuration by Quassum Manus

[!["Buy Me A Coffee"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bring.shrubbery)

## Overview

This package provides what we see as a must have prettier configuration for every project.
This includes some default prettier options that we like, as well as some prettier plugins.
You can see the list of the prettier plugins used below:

- [`@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`](https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports)

> Note: the plugins come as dependencies of this package, so you don't have to install them separately.

## Usage

To use this config install it first:

```
yarn add -D @quassum/prettier-config
```

or

```
npm install -D @quassum/prettier-config
```

Then create local `.prettierrc.js` file and add this into it:

```js
module.exports = {
  ...require("@quassum/prettier-config"),
};
```

> Note: you also have to have [`prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) installed for it to work properly.

## Versioning
