_Last Updated: 09-10-2024_

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy outlines the practices of Quassum MB regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information for users of our "SVG to SwiftUI Converter" web application and its Figma plugin version, as well as other variations of the program.

## Information Collection and Use

### Web Application

- **SVG to SwiftUI Code Conversion:** The conversion of SVG code to SwiftUI code is performed entirely on the user's device. The application does not upload or store the user's code on any server.
- **Analytics:** The application utilizes various analytics tools to collect anonymous traffic data. This data is used solely for improving the application and understanding user interaction patterns. The primary analytics tool used is Google Analytics. For more information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please refer to [How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).
- **No Personal Data Collection:** The application does not collect, store, or process any personal information from its users. There is no functionality to create an account, and all usage is completely anonymous.

### Third-Party Data Collection

Since we're using third-party solutions for analytics, please refer to their respective privacy policies for more information:

- **Google Analytics:** [Google Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### Figma Plugin

## Data Security

Quassum MB is committed to protecting the security of your data. As the application operates entirely on your device without transmitting data to external servers, your information remains under your control.
